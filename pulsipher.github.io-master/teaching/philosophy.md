# Overview
My teaching philosophy focuses on promoting a <b>growth mindset</b> in an <b>active learning</b> environment that is <b>inclusive</b> for all; I have refined this through experience in instructing courses on organic chemistry, process control, chemical process modeling, and advanced decision-making.

# Active Learning
Active learning seeks a dynamic learning environment that readily <b>encourages student engagement</b>, contrary to traditional lecture-based approaches. I employ a <b>flipped classroom</b> where I cover new material via concise video lectures and use classroom time to conduct supervised learning exercises that allow students to engage in <b>deliberate practice</b>. I establish clear learning objectives based on <b>Bloom's taxonomy</b> (which defines 6 cognitive learning processes and 4 types of knowledge) to guide the development of instruction, assessments, and exercises (e.g., think-pair-share, concept mapping, and live polling). I also provide my students with a <b>transparent teaching vision</b> at the beginning of a course, so they know that I will use cutting-edge teaching strategies, advocate for their success, and solicit their feedback for improvement.

# Learning with a Growth Mindset
A growth mindset affirms that mastery comes with <b>sufficient time and effort</b> in contrast to the misconception that intelligence/mastery is innate which stifles progress, promotes superficial understanding, and discourages active learning. To promote a growth mindset, I directly discuss this concept, recognize students' improvement, and structure courses that <b>reward genuine effort</b> such that failures become opportunities for learning. For instance, I encourage students to submit <b>test corrections</b> to regain partial credit. I also assist individual students identify effective learning strategies on which to focus their effort. This is an especially important for STEM students who are often discouraged by a barrage of challenging courses (e.g., chemistry, mathematics, thermodynamics). In short, I strive to establish a classroom with the understanding that <b>everyone can excel</b> regardless of the ease at which understanding comes initially.

# Inclusive Learning Environment
Inclusive learning environments allow all students (especially underrepresented groups) to <b>feel a sense of belonging</b> and to equitably receive the support they need. I strive to foster an inclusive learning environment via a <b>transparently inclusive teaching</b> style, connecting personally, determining student expectations, modeling inclusive language/behavior, providing <b>diverse channels of participation</b>, facilitating collaborative small group work, and soliciting frequent <b>anonymous student feedback</b>. I also do not tolerate any derogatory, offensive, or discriminatory comments/actions (taking swift recourse as needed). Finally, my lived experience in battling physical disabilities empassions me to ensure that all are <b>equitably accommodated</b> in my classroom and beyond.

# The Interplay Between Research and Teaching
Learning from some professors I've observed overfocus on research to the detriment of their teaching engagement, I endeavor to use the same standard of excellence in both my teaching and research pursuits. Furthermore, I plan to <b>leverage my research to innovate course curriculum</b>; for instance, I can incorporate excerpts from my research to instruct how <b>uncertainty/statistics</b> (a common weak-point for students) play an important role in the subject matter (e.g., chemical process design). This allows me to discuss areas I am passionate about and encourage undergraduate research. I can also tie my research directly into relevant graduate-level courses.
