		<p> Teaching is arguably the avenue through which professors have the most influence and impact on society; it is the primary medium to train and mentor the next generation of engineers to tackle the grand engineering challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup> century such as climate change, sustainable energy production, sufficient food supply, and better engineered medicines. Fueled by my passion for mentoring and teaching, I have consistently sought out instruction opportunities throughout my professional career.</p>
