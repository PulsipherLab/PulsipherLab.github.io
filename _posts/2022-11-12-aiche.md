I am a faculty candidate this year at the AICHE 2022 Annual Meeting. I will be giving a number of talks this year:
- Faculty Poster: <a href="https://plan.core-apps.com/aiche2022/event/970ee5aa95fe95e5ab3194f8a5889ee7"><i>Decision-Making and Learning Under Uncertainty for Complex Systems</i></a>, Nov. 13 at 1:00 pm in North Hall E
- Plenary Talk: <a href="https://plan.core-apps.com/aiche2022/event/c8794e6fccbbe777d43932b924520640"><i>Event Constrained Optimization</i></a>, Nov. 14 at 9:10 am in N-224AB 
- Talk: <a href="https://plan.core-apps.com/aiche2022/event/bbaa65f416331d3534c754dd9cf36276"><i>New Measures for Shaping Trajectories in Dynamic Optimization</i></a>, Nov. 15 at 8:00 am in W-101C  
- Talk: <a href="https://plan.core-apps.com/aiche2022/event/0fe0894cea90bdd81d4b8e65009d0a02"><i>Computer Vision Aided Process Control: Methods for Enhanced Autonomy and Robustness</i></a>, Nov. 15 at 9:54 am in W-101B

My research vision focuses on tackling challenges in sustainability, energy, and the environment by developing methods in data science & decision-making under uncertainty with discoveries accelerated and made accessible by engineered software frameworks.
